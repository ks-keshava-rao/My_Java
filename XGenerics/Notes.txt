1. By this Generalization can be achieved .
2. Converting a subclass type into a superclass type is called ‘Generalization‘ because we are making the subclass to
     become more general and its scope is widening. This is also called widening or up casting. Widening is safe because the classes will become more general.
3. Refernce of an object can hold object can hold any any class . Object obj = new String("new");
4. String str = obj // not allowed directly by super class reference 
5. String str = (String) obj.
6. if no paramerters are passed then the value will be treated as object and can be store value of any datatype.
7. multiple paramerters are also allowed
8. Bounded types 
class A {}
class B extends A{}
class C extends B{} 

class my<T extends Number> // This allows only those classes which are extending from Number class 
ex - my<Float> f = new my<>(); // same thing for interfaces
