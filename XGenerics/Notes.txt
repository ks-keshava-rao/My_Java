1. By this Generalization can be achieved .
2. Converting a subclass type into a superclass type is called ‘Generalization‘ because we are making the subclass to
     become more general and its scope is widening. This is also called widening or up casting. Widening is safe because the classes will become more general.
3. Refernce of an object can hold object can hold any any class . Object obj = new String("new");
4. String str = obj // not allowed directly by super class reference 
5. String str = (String) obj.
