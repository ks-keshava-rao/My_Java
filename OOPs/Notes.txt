Object oriented programming
1. Abstraction  :- 
                    1) Hiding internal detail and showing only the relavant part 
                   increased security , reduces complexity , avoids code duplication .

2. Encapsulation :- 
                    1) Single entity wrapping , every java class is an example of Encapsulation , because we write everything within the 
                    class only that binds variables and methods together and hides their complexity from other classes.
                    2) If the field is declared private in the class then it cannot be accessed by anyone from o
                    outside the class and hides field within the class. Therefore, it is also called data hiding. Encapsulation = Data Hiding + Abstraction
                    3)Getter and setter methods are used to read and write the private members .
                    4) ex: gmail , email , bank balance .

3. Inheritance :-   1) Inheriting the properties and behaviour of parent class .
                    2) Specialization :- modifying and changing some thing in the existing thing and makikng something new .

4. Polymorphism :-  1) Generalization :- something that can be addressed by general term and refered to a set of things by one name . ex students , cars .
                    2) Polymorphism is a concept in which we can execute a single operation in different ways.
